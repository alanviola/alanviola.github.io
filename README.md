# About this repo

## Layout
Please see the Academic documentation (e.g. https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/ and https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/) for an explanation of the repo structure. The generated site is in `public/` which is kept out of the Git repo.

## How to contribute
Create a new branch for your modifications. Please do not work directly on the master branch - it should always generate the latest (non-broken) public website. Make edits on your own branch, then create a pull request & have labmates review your changes.

We may need to use `git lfs` if we have large files e.g. notebooks.

## Setup
from https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic#create-your-site-on-your-computer-with-git
- `brew install hugo`
- `git clone --bare https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git`
- created private repo, `git push --mirror https://github.com/uw-cryo/lab-website.git`
- `git clone https://github.com/uw-cryo/lab-website`
- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- create new branch with `git checkout -b example-site`
- `cp -av themes/academic/exampleSite/* .`
    - copied the demo content in
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "Initialize site with the demo content"`
- `git push --set-upstream origin example-site`
- how to debug locally
    - run `hugo` to generate `public` folder
    - `python -m http.server 1234` from the `lab-website/public` folder
    - in browser, go to `localhost:1234`


### Sections we'd like to add
- Intro
- Posts
- People (just add folders in `authors`)
- Projects ()
- Publications
- Data
- Code
- Fieldwork
- Get involved/DEI/outreach/donate
- Contact (just leaving this for now)
- Funding? (maybe should go in intro)

## Other next steps
- [ ] https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/deployment/#github-pages (if we want to use github pages)
- [ ] Try importing your publications with https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-admin
- [ ] Investigate options for more complicated sections like `Data` (if we want interactive visualizations)


## How to add a new group member bio
1. Starting from the tacolab-website git directory, cd to the authors/ dir

3. Edit the _index.md file (change all the bits to fit you)  
`cd new_user/`  
`nano _index.md`
4. Add a prof pic in your authors/ dir and rename it  
`mv prof_pic.jpg avatar.jpg`
5. Run and refresh the site locally (follow steps 6‚Äì8 on [**Website walkthrough**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ad_FNJqooKXiRZEbVTm43clrr8kXTE9GVIXrAAnkIi8/edit#)) to see your changes  
6. Then
`git add new_user/`  
`git commit -m ‚Äúdescriptive message‚Äù`  
and `git push`
your profile changes up to the main branch (after checking out that it‚Äôs what you want)
