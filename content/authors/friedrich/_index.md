Friedrich Knuth is a PhD student in the UW Hydrology and Hydrodynamics Program. He received his B.Sc. in structural geology from William and Mary and M.Sc. in acoustic remote sensing from the College of Charleston. 

Prior to embarking on a PhD at University of Washington, Friedrich worked as a Wireline Engineer for Schlumberger GmbH, Software QA lead for Apple Inc., and big data analyst for NSFs OOI Cabled Array.

His current PhD research focuses on reconstructing the 3D evolution of mountain glaciers in response to climate forcing, using historical aerial photography and satellite imagery collected over the past century.
