Chris Hayner is a PhD student in the AA department at the UW. His current research involves using machine learning and sensor fusuion techniques to analyze real-time data from a UAV to identify and rescue lost human's in wilderness environments. More broadly he is interested in utilizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyze a variety of live sensor inputs in complex autonomous systems in order to make a robust agent capable of performing in uncertain and challenging environments.
