Welcome to the UW Terrain Analysis and Cryosphere Observation Lab in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. (Text to change... just copied from dshean.github.io)
Lab in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington. Our research involves the development and application of new methods to study dynamic Earth system components with real-world implications for water resources, sea level rise, and natural hazards. 

 # Our current research uses satellite, airborne, UAV, and terrestrial remote sensing observations to understand the Earthâ€™s cryosphere, with focus on mountain glaciers, seasonal snow, and ice sheets. Much of this work requires modern data science approaches and high-performance computing to answer questions that cannot be addressed using traditional approaches.

 # Questions we want to answer:
 # - how deep is the snow?

 # We are generously funded by x, y z thank you that's very kind
