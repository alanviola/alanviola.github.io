Michelle Hu is a PhD student in the Hydrology and Hydrodynamics Program in the Terrain Analysis and Cryosphere Observation Lab. She received her BS in Biology and International Studies from the University of Wisconsin - Madison and her MS in Water Resources Science from Oregon State University.

Before joining the TACO lab, she built trails, traveled through the public lands of the western US and Central America, and picked up rock climbing and snowboarding. 

Her current research focuses on very-high-resolution remote sensing of seasonal snow using machine learning and optical and terrain-based data fusion in the Western US. She is broadly interested in water resources and climate interconnections, extreme events, transdiscplinary perspectives and people-focused data science applications.
