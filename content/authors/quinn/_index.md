Quinn Brencher is a PhD student interested in using various remote sensing tools to study ice 
and permafrost dynamics, cryosphere hazards, and water resources. His current project involves observing 
potential hazards in recently deglaciated landscapes in High Mountain Asia using InSAR, SAR backscatter, 
high resolution digital elevation models and imagery, and laser altimetry. 

Quinn grew up in Connecticut and graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont in 2020. As an 
undergraduate, Quinn worked to identify and monitor active and transitional rock glaciers in the Uinta 
Mountains, Utah, using InSAR. Quinn is passionate about science accessibility and is working on a 
website to host plain language versions of academic papers. 

When he isn't doing science, Quinn enjoys cooking (and eating), experimental music, outdoors adventures, and appreciating great design wherever he 
finds it. Quinn is happy to talk about rock and ice, science accessibility, or life as a grad student 
with anyone who is interested!
