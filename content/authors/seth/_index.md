Seth Vanderwilt is a second-year PhD student in the Terrain Analysis and Cryosphere Observation Lab, part of the Hydrology and Hydrodynamics program of UW CEE. He received his B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Washington and his MSc in Computer Science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).

His research currently includes investigations of deep learning models for 2D imagery and 3D scene representations, for example to produce refined digital elevation models based on satellite stereo optical imagery or other inputs.
