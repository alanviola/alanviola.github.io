# An Action Peaked Wednesday - post in progress


On October 7th 2020 some of the TACO lab woke up bright and early for a socially distanced trip to Easton Glacier on Mt. Baker. After a long hike filled with a perilous river crossing, friendly conversations with other hikers, screeching hoary marmots, and a couple of mycology lessons, David, Michelle, Friedrich, and Eric set up a base of operations on the moraine pictured in the gallery below. The fieldwork consisted of multiple automated flights of an eBee senseFly UAV pathed down the glacier at a height of (X) meters. (insert picture of path?) (Maybe some talk about the resolution?) After some initial issues, we were able to fly (??three??) successful missions. The images produced by the UAV will be used in structure from motion analysis in order to build high resolution digital elevation models. (diagram of SfM?) Some preliminary data is pictured below. (example data?)

After a long day of hard work, the group stopped off at Chipotle and had a nice socially distanced dinner together in the parking lot. With aching bodies and full tummies, the group made it back to Seattle just in time for bed. With the trip behind us, we look forward to analyzing the data and sharing the memories of our adventure.

Check out some captioned pictures of the trip:


And a video of David launching the UAV:
