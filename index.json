Much of this work requires modern data science approaches and high-performance computing to answer questions that cannot be addressed using traditional approaches.\nDavid’s early research involved documenting past glaciation and evidence for climate change on Mars. He went on to work for Yellowstone National Park, where he studied dynamic hydrothermal features, and then Boston University, where he performed geophysical surveys of glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains. From 2007-2011, David worked for Malin Space Science Systems as a member of the NASA Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX) and Mars Color Imager (MARCI) science operations team. His PhD research at the University of Washington documented the evolution of ice-shelf basal melt and ice-stream dynamics in West Antarctica to better understand future ice-sheet stability.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a188323511e886023c2ed76753cf8aaf","permalink":"https://uw-cryo.github.io/authors/david/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/david/","section":"authors","summary":"David Shean is an assistant professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Washington.

I am interested in deriving scientific insights by utilizing the tools of data science to tackle geoscience problems, particularly as applied to remote-sensing of the cryosphere. This includes automated processing pipelines of remote-sensing data products, such as automated feature detection on glaciers from a variety of satellite data sources. Furthermore, I’m interested in interpretable machine learning approaches in exploring complex dynamic systems.\nWe are at the cusp of a revolution in geoscience, and specifically glaciology, where the sheer volume of observational data will shift the current bottleneck in our understanding from data availability to processing ability and interpretability. The parallel advancements in computational tools, from probabilistic programming platforms to machine learning and big data in geosciences, provide the perfect opportunity to push the limits of our understanding of changes in the cryosphere.\nI’m also interested in improving our understanding of glaciological processes contributing to sea level rise. To that end, quantifying mass balance of glaciers at a regional level and understanding glacier dynamics are of crucial importance. I believe interpretable machine learning approaches can also assist with an improved understanding of key, but difficult to model processes, such as marine ice cliff instability.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e7960789ba023f30e7978be70b972881","permalink":"https://uw-cryo.github.io/authors/yara/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/yara/","section":"authors","summary":"My research interests lie at the intersection of data science and geoscience.

Baker. After a long hike filled with a perilous river crossing, friendly conversations with other hikers, screeching hoary marmots, and a couple of mycology lessons, David, Michelle, Friedrich, and Eric set up a base of operations on the moraine pictured in the gallery below. The fieldwork consisted of multiple automated flights of an eBee senseFly UAV pathed down the glacier at a height of (X) meters. (insert picture of path?) (Maybe some talk about the resolution?) After some initial issues, we were able to fly (??three??) successful missions. The images produced by the UAV will be used in structure from motion analysis in order to build high resolution digital elevation models. (diagram of SfM?) Some preliminary data is pictured below. (example data?)\nAfter a long day of hard work, the group stopped off at Chipotle and had a nice socially distanced dinner together in the parking lot. With aching bodies and full tummies, the group made it back to Seattle just in time for bed.
